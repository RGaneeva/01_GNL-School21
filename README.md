# GET_NEXT_LINE

School 21 (Ecole42) 'get_next_line' project. Score 100/100

The second project that I implemented at school 21 - the preparation of another one assistant for writing in future more serious projects.
This function helps in reading information from the file/ fd/ stdin/ network connection.

Also in this project I met with static variables and their role in programming on C language.
